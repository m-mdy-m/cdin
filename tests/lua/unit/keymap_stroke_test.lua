local T = require "harness"

-- The rule, and the reason it needs a test of its own:
--
-- A stroke in a keymap table is not a description of a key press. It is a
-- claim about the exact string the input layer builds -- "ctrl+", "alt+",
-- "altgr+", "shift+", then the key's own name -- and `keymap.map` is indexed by
-- that string with no normalisation, no aliases and no case folding. So a
-- stroke that differs in modifier order, in case, or in where its '+' signs
-- are is not a near miss: it is a string no key press produces, and the
-- binding dies in the one way that is completely silent -- on_key_pressed
-- misses, returns false, nothing is written anywhere.
--
-- Two of them shipped. ["ctrl+s+l"] in the log view's layer, with the docs
-- and the view's own header both saying F2, and ["ctrl+shift+alt+n"] in
-- cdin-x's treeview. This file covers the checker that now says so at boot;
-- scripts/test_commands.lua covers the runtime's own bindings against it.
--
-- core.input.command requires core, which loads core.style at require time --
-- so the renderer and system globals have to stand in before the require, the
-- same way unit/themes_test.lua does it.
